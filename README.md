# E.C.F- Niue Project

# Overview

As part of the client project phase of the nology 12 week full stack course, our cohort was asked to build a website for the Early Years Foundation which provided a set of courses aimed at careers within the financial services industry.

We created the app in React and utilised skills learned in HTML, SCSS and JavaScript. To allow users to log in with their own profile and benefit from a more tailored experience, we used FireBase from google to provide the authentication.

The project ran for four weeks, using Agile methodology to assign and manage workloads. Each week, a product owner was assigned to the sprint and it was their responsibility to plan and assign the tickets and write the acceptance criteria for completion.

We split off in to pairs and ran a week long sprint during which time we were assigned tickets using Trello. At the start of each coding session, we held a stand up to run through progress made and planned work scheduled for that session.

We were also able to run through any blockers to progress and talk through solution with team members. Each sprint ended with a demo to the clients. A git branching strategy was used to work on multiple features. Once a pull request was completed the feature would be added to the codebase.
